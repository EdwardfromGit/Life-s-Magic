            <h2>Edward Wang</h2>
            <p><strong>Founder & Creator of Life's Magic</strong></p>
            <p>Hi, I'm Edward Wang, the creator of Life's Magic. I believe that building habits is like constructing your own kingdomâ€”brick by brick, day by day. Life's Magic was born out of my passion for self-improvement and my love for gaming. I wanted to create something that merges productivity with fun, helping people level up both in-game and in real life.</p>
